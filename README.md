# DROP_SUPERHYDROPHOBIC_WEDGE
Supplementary Code for "Fluid Dynamics of Droplet Impact and Splitting on Superhydrophobic Wedges"

## Description
This repository provides the supplementary test case code for the open-source OpenFOAM framework, associated with the study titled "Fluid Dynamics of Droplet Impact and Splitting on Superhydrophobic Wedges". The case setup is designed to simulate droplet impact dynamics, including spreading, splitting, retraction, and daughter droplet lift-off on superhydrophobic wedge geometries.

## key features
This work uses the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method to track the droplet interface, enabling analysis of droplet impact, spreading, splitting and droplet lift-off on superhydrophobic wedges.
Superhydrophobicity on the wedge surface is achieved by implementing the KistlerDynamicContactAngle model as a boundary condition.

## How to test
It works on OpenFOAM-2.2.0.


```bash
    git clone https://github.com/varaprasadgudlavalleti/DROP_SUPERHYDROPHOBIC_WEDGE/
